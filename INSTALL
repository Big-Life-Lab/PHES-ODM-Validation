Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system before
starting. The required version can be found in pyproject.toml.

If you only want to install the package, you can run the following command:

`pip install "git+https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/PHES-ODM-Validation.git@main"`

If you want to set up a development environment instead, run the following
commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/PHES-ODM-Validation.git odm-validation
pip install -e ./odm-validation
```

Tests can be run with the following commands (after setting up a dev. env.):

```
pip install ./tests/requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover ./tests
```

The package documentation can be generated by following the instructions in
docs/README.md.

# Contributing

The PHES-ODM validation tool kit is an open source and community-driven. You can make suggestions for new validation rules or comment on existing rules on the PHES-ODM [discussion board](https://odm.discourse.group) or GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/PHES-ODM-Validation/issues).

## Adding a new rule

New validation rules can be requested by anyone ODM user. Instructions on how to add a new rule is found in [/validation-rules/README.md](validation-rules/validation-rules/README.md). The validation rules README.md is a good source of additional information about how rules work.
